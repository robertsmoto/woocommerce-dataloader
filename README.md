# woocommerce-dataloader
A custom data loader for use between your product data and wordpress-woocommerce.

# Project Description
This is a solution for integrating your own inventory database with woocommerce. This project is most aptly described as a data loader, rather than a synchonizer. It is, for the most part, a one-way data loading tool that pushes updated product data to woocommerce and pulls order information from woo. It is written in Python and utilizes the python subprocess commands and the wordpress-woocommerce cli.

This is definitely not a plug-and-play solution, rather it is a starting point for your project. It will take development work to integrate this to your own personal project, but the code should give you a good running start.
